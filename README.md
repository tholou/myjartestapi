# myjartestapi
Back End Developer Job Interview at MYJAR written with Node JS
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Things you need to install the software.

* You need to have an environment set up (i.e Node Js and MongoDB is installed).
* Kindly run `npm -v` and `mongo --version` as these will show you the version of NPM and MongoDB installed on your machine.
* If you donâ€™t have it installed, kindly go through this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) on how to install it in order for you to create a server in Node and [Mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

### Installing
Provided, all steps above are done, run the following command in the terminal
```
* npm install
* npm run start
``` 

You should see the following on your terminal, after `npm run` start:
```
MYJAR Test RESTful API server started on:3000
```

Finally, open a new terminal and run mongod to start Mongo DB.

Set Up Completed Succefully, now you can test the API endpoints in Postman, like this `http://localhost:3000/api/users`.
